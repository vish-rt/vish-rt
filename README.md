# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <img align='right' src='assets/meirl.gif' width='400'>

My name is Vishal Rawat

## About me:

Self-proclaimed software developer with a deep passion and interest within backend architecture and database systems. Picked up the keyboard to code for the first time as a 12 year old and have not seen a stop for it in the big future.

I love to build in public and engage with like-minded individuals across various communities across the globe. Always look forward to connect, communicate and collaborate with you all!

## Expertise
- I enjoy the process of development of a full-stack application, from scratch.
- Worked time and again on backend projects: from structuring the database to writing API calls for the same.
- Decent amount of experience in writing the backend architecture in multiple tech stacks.
- Sound understanding of Data Structures and their applications in modern-day projects.
